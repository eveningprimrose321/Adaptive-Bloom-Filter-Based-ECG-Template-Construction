The ECG data is PTB Diagnostic ECG Database (https://physionet.org/content/ptbdb/1.0.0/).

We did some preprocessing steps and splited the ECG records into beatbundles (as described in paper).



For a clearer observation of how parameters affect the EER results, you may open these file in Spyder to easily change lots of different parameters.üòÅ
(All the default parameters are same as those in paper.)
